Boring History:

	A long while ago I made this texindex for OS/2 from some
sources I  found on the net somewhere.  I ported it over, (after a few
tries that is,) and everything works fine.  I've been using it every
since.  As you can tell, it has been a while since I did this in late
1994.

	I recently got a PC work, as opposed to just a workstation, and
so I got to install OS/2 at work.  I decided that I would have a new go
at installing TeX and LaTeX at work, and I would create a new directory
structure and include MetaFont.  All went well, (as well as can be
expected anyway.)  Then I went about trying to texindex to add to this
to complete the picture and couldn't.  Then I tried, without too much
effort, to download and port texindex again.  I kept porting and it
kept crashing.  I've realized that this version may be usefull, so here
it is.


Some notes on building it:

	This port IS NOT built with EMX.  It does not require EMX to
run.  It was built with GCC, but with GCC/2.  A port done by Colin
Jensen.  (Kudos to Colin, too bad he stopped.)  I don't know if anyone
else in the world used GCC/2, but myself, so I don't know what you can
do with these sources.  If you find them usefull, I'm happy for you, if
not, delete them!


Pathetic Excuse for Installation directions:

	copy texindex.exe to wherever you keep your other TeX and LaTeX
exectuables.
